TOPIC: EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM NAME:PRATEEK
1. Introduction
The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed Low-Level Design (LLD) for the 
Advanced Employee Feedback Management System. The system facilitates comprehensive 
feedback collection, performance evaluation, and organizational development through 360-
degree feedback, peer reviews, self-assessments, and AI-powered analytics. It employs a 
desktop application architecture using Python with tkinter GUI framework and MySQL 
database for local deployment.
This design uses core Python libraries with local AI processing capabilities, ensuring 
complete data privacy and independence from external services or internet connectivity.
2. Module Overview
The project consists of the following modules:
2.1 User Management
• Manages employee profiles, authentication, role-based access control, and 
organizational hierarchy.
2.2 Feedback Management
• Handles creation, submission, tracking, and lifecycle management of various 
feedback types including self-assessment, peer feedback, and manager reviews.
2.3 Local AI Analytics
• Processes feedback content using local Python libraries for sentiment analysis, 
automated categorization, and priority detection without external dependencies.
2.4 Review and Workflow Management
• Manages feedback review processes, approval workflows, response tracking, and 
escalation mechanisms.
2.5 Performance Analytics and Reporting
• Provides comprehensive analytics, trend analysis, performance insights, and 
exportable reports with data visualization capabilities.
2.6 Notification and Communication
• Manages internal notifications, alerts, reminders, and system communications 
through desktop notifications and in-application messaging.
3. Architecture Overview
3.1 Architectural Style
• Application Type: Desktop Application
• Frontend: Python tkinter with custom widgets and forms
• Backend: Python business logic with direct database connectivity
• Database: MySQL with mysql-connector-python
• AI Processing: Local Python libraries (TextBlob, pandas, numpy, matplotlib)
3.2 Component Interaction
1. Desktop GUI communicates with Python controller classes through event handling.
2. Controller layer processes business logic and coordinates data operations.
3. Model layer interacts with MySQL database for data persistence and retrieval.
4. AI engine processes feedback content locally using offline Python libraries.
5. All components operate within single Python application process without external 
API calls.
